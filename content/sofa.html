        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>The very first consideration you’ll need to make while selecting the right sofa is where you are going to put it. In a living room, where one entertains and sits with other members of the family, a fabric or leather big sofa might just be the perfect one. In a bedroom or a smaller space, a 2-seater sofa or single sofa could provide the same amount of comfort without flooding the room. If you’re decorating a home office or a quiet nook, this compact and stylish piece from the Togo sofa series would be perfect.</p>

      </summary>
      <div class="answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>Choose the right size to ensure that the sofa fits accordingly in your space. Size the area where your sofa will be to avoid it appearing crammed up. For people with limited space, consider using single sofas. Larger rooms can afford and accommodate larger, more expansive designs and even multiple series’ pieces in the 2-seater Togo sofa series.</p>

        <h3 itemprop="name">What Is the Ideal Seat Height and Depth for a Sofa?</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>Seat height and depth determine how comfortable your sofa is, really. The perfect seat height is between 45 and 50 cm, giving you a comfortable sitting experience and allowing you to get up easily. Choose a depth of the seat according to your needs for comfort: Deeper seats, about 55 to 60 cm, are perfect for lounging, while shallower ones at around 50 cm offer better support for more upright seating.</p>

        <h3 itemprop="name">Does the Sofa Complement the Interior Design, Including the Color?</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>Your sofa should coordinate with your house decor. Think how that style and color sofa will slide right into your current design. A neutral palette like greys, beige, and browns is always accommodating and tends to merge well with most interiors, while a strong color can highlight the room. The Togo sofa series will fit modern, contemporary settings. While a classic leather sofa may fit more traditional interiors.</p>

        <h3 itemprop="name">What is important when choosing the upholstery of a sofa?</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>Upholstery is a very important aspect of the look, comfort, and durability of your sofa. Fabric sofas come in suede and wool varieties that produce a warm, soft feeling in your room. There is no doubt that a leather sofa looks timeless and chic and is very durable, although it requires regular maintenance. Match your way of life by upholstering the furniture to factors such as durability, comfort, and easy-to-clean characteristics.</p>

        <h3 itemprop="name">How is a high-quality sofa constructed?</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          <p>It’s the building construction that defines quality in a sofa. A good and strong hardwood frame speaks for durability. Good-quality sofas often include eight-way hand-tied springs or sinuous spring constructions to provide maximum support. In addition, cushion filling also matters. Down-filled cushions are comfortable but very high-maintenance; firm support is provided by high-density foam, and it takes more time for the foam to lose its shape.</p>
